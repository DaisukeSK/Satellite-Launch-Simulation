when satellite landed planet, make it touch the surface of planet

when run app with console open, planet list shadow dosen't work properly

during satellite running, when click upper middle part of viewport, inputs are abled

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
difference between offsetWidth and getBoundingClientRect.width?
If use offsetWidth, value is rounded

when sate reaches surface, altitude=0 shown after alert and one more step is run after clearInterval
if fixed, clear parameters on the left after launch aborted
// Fixed by using setTimeout, but is it the best way?
