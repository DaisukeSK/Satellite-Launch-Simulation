# Satellite Launch Simulation

This is a numerical simulation of a satellite's behavior going around the planet, created based on a formula for gravity. You can try it in various situations.

This is made only with [`JavaScript`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/).

## Run the Project

Clone the repo in your local machine and open `index.html` in your browser with local server environment.\

## Project Description

This is a numerical satellite-launch simulation built based on the formula for gravity shown below.<br/>
<img src='./assets/formula.png'>

This simulation is to simulate how the artificial satellite goes around the planet depending on parameters you set.<br/>
To try simlation, input launch velocity and altitude on the left side.<br/>
Simulation will start sa soon as you click "Launch" button and you can see how the satellite behaves.<br/>

You can also select the planets from many selections by clicking the arrow on the top.<br/>
The satellite will behave differently depending on the parameters and planet you set.
