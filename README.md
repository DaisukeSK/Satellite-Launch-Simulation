This simulation is to simulate how the artificial satellite goes around the planet depending on parameters you set.
To try simlation, input launch velocity and altitude on the left side.
Simulation will start sa soon as you click "Launch" button and you can see how the satellite behaves.

You can also select the planets from many selections by clicking the arrow on the top.
The satellite will behave differently depending on the parameters and planet you set.
