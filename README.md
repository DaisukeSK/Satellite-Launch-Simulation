# Satellite Launch Simulation

This is a numerical simulation made with [`JavaScript`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) only, built based on a formula for gravity, which allows you to simulate how an artificial satellite travels around the planet after the launch depending on parameters you set.

## Run the Project

1. Clone the repo in your local machine and open `index.html` in your browser with local server environment.\
   (ex. Open it with `Live Server` of `VS code`)\

2. Input launch velocity and altitude on the left side bar.\
   Simulation will start sa soon as you click `Launch` button and you can observe how the satellite behaves.\

3. You can also select the planets/starts from many selections by clicking the arrow on the top.\
   The satellite will behave differently depending on the parameters and planet you set.
