This simulation is to simulate how the artificial satellite goes around the planet depending on parameters you set.<br/>
To try simlation, input launch velocity and altitude on the left side.<br/>
Simulation will start sa soon as you click "Launch" button and you can see how the satellite behaves.<br/>

You can also select the planets from many selections by clicking the arrow on the top.<br/>
The satellite will behave differently depending on the parameters and planet you set.
