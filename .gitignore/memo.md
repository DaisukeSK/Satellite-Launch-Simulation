when satellite landed planet, make it touch the surface of planet

what is display:flex in .middle for?

input validation

launchBtn.onclick in main js should have the same if-condition as input validation in launch.js??

when ceres selected, alt=500 need to be shown to all parameter displays

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
difference between offsetWidth and getBoundingClientRect.width?
If use offsetWidth, value is rounded

when sate reaches surface, altitude=0 shown after alert and one more step is run after clearInterval
if fixed, clear parameters on the left after launch aborted
// Fixed by using setTimeout, but is it the best way?
